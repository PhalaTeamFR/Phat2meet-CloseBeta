Phat Contract Closed Beta is launched before the release of [Phat Contract](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/general/intro/) on Phala mainnet. The aim of it is to monitor the experience of developers, identify any potential issues, and then address them in order to improve the quality of our service.

Both Phala's partner projects and individual developers are involved in this test. The contents to experience in the Closed Beta is listed in our [wiki](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/general/closed-beta/). Individual developers need to apply for the test first by filling in this [form](https://forms.gle/sbCDHfu7t9SNvytB7).

Phala proposes a Closed Beta prize pool to encourage the engagement,  and this repository is for individual developers to submit their projects to win the rewards.

The PhalaTeamFr is the french team organized by the french ambassadors for PhalaNetwork.
Our community is organised around several place where anyone who want to understand the power of the project can follow, discuss, train or share about it.
We are present on [Telegram](https://t.me/phala_french), [Discord](https://discord.io/PhalaTeamFr), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phala_fr), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@phalafr?sub_confirmation=1), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/phalanetworkfr), [github](https://github.com/PhalaTeamFR) and [medium](https://medium.com/phala-fran%C3%A7ais).
  
At the launch of the ClosedBeta for the PhatContract, french ambassadors purpose to constitute a team to represent our community in this challenge. That was really ambitious at the beguinning because nobody in participants had knowledges in Blockchain developement and with the language Rust. To organize our project and show our progress to the french community, each wednesday at 21h since the 8th february we oraganized 11 online events on the fr discord.

# The Phat2meet

Phat Contract Closed Beta is launched before the release of [Phat Contract](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/general/intro/) on Phala mainnet. The aim of it is to monitor the experience of developers, identify any potential issues, and then address them in order to improve the quality of our service.

Both Phala's partner projects and individual developers are involved in this test. The contents to experience in the Closed Beta is listed in our [wiki](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/general/closed-beta/). Individual developers need to apply for the test first by filling in this [form](https://forms.gle/sbCDHfu7t9SNvytB7).

Phala proposes a Closed Beta prize pool to encourage the engagement,  and this repository is for individual developers to submit their projects to win the rewards.
